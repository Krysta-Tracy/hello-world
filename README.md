# hello-world
Opening project on this awesome site!

My name is Krysta Tracy! Just getting into computer programming... Currently taking a Front End Web Development course over at Udacity. Relocated recently to Florida from Colorado, though I'm from Pennsylvaia originally! I am excited to see where I can take this exciting road from here! Hit me up with any potential collaborations or just hit me up! I would love to make new friends in the community! :)
